/*
 * Program Description:
 * --------------------
 * This program calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using recursion.
 * Weâ€™ll keep things recursive, which makes us look like smart mathematicians 
 * (or at least, it makes us feel like one).
 *
 * Steps to Resolve:
 * -----------------
 * 1. Start with the base case: If N is 0, the sum is 0 (because 0 + ... = 0).
 * 2. For every recursive call, we add the current number to the sum of the smaller problem (N-1).
 * 3. Feel free to brag about how cool recursion makes summing numbers look.

    }

    // Recursive call: Add the current number to the sum of the remaining numbers.
    return n + sumOfNumbers(n - 1);
